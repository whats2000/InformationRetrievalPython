# Information Retrieval Course Labs

This repository contains lab experiments developed for the Master's level Information Retrieval course. The experiments explore various information retrieval concepts and techniques.

## Directory Structure

*   `BooleanRetrieval`: Contains code and experiments related to boolean retrieval models.
*   `Course`: Contains course-related experiments, divided into several subdirectories:
    *   `AttentionModel`: Experiments using attention models.
    *   `ClasifierCluster`: Experiments related to classification and clustering.
    *   `LargeLanguageModel`: Experiments involving large language models.
    *   `LearningToRank`: Experiments focusing on learning-to-rank techniques.
    *   `VectorModel`: Experiments on vector-based retrieval models.

## Key Files

*   `BooleanRetrieval/`: Python modules for boolean retrieval, including `inverted_index.py` and `utils.py`.
*   Each subdirectory within `Course/` contains Jupyter Notebooks (`.ipynb`) for specific experiments.

## Usage

To explore the experiments, navigate to the respective directories and open the Jupyter Notebooks. The notebooks provide detailed instructions for each experiment.
